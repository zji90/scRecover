Description: scRecover is an R package for imputation of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data.
    It will detect and impute dropout values in a scRNA-seq raw read counts matrix while 
    keeping the real zeros unchanged, since there are both dropout zeros and real zeros in 
    scRNA-seq data. By combination with scImpute, SAVER and MAGIC, scRecover not only detects 
    dropout and real zeros at higher accuracy, but also improve the downstream clustering and 
    visualization results.
